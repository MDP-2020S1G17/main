# Checklist items pertaining to Arduino:

- [ ] A3: Sensors calibrated to correctly return distance to obstacle
  - 1st object: 30-50cm away
  - 2nd object: 50-70cm away
  - To +/-6% accuracy


- [ ] A4: Accurate straight line movement
  - Traverse in straight line within arena and stop at a distance between 100-150 given by supervisor
  - Robot should not deviate from straight-line
  - To +/- 6% accuracy

- [ ] A5: Accurate rotation
  - Rotate between 720-1080 degrees
  - Location of robot should not deviate > 10cm away
  - To +/- 6% accuracy

(With algo)
- [ ] A6/A7: Obstacle avoidance and position recovery (straight line)
  - Robot should be able to detect presence of a single 10x10cm obstacle and take evasive action
  - Robot should return to original line
  - A7 (Extentsion) -- Stop 10-15cm before obstacle and take a diagonal avoidance path
